Difference b/w simulator and emulator-
Simulator:
	easy & early s/w application creation
	low cost alternative to h/w
	deep insight into application behavior
	eg:
		armsim
		xilinx
		flight simulator
Emulator:
	accurate real-time h/w-s/w system interactions
	precise behavior of system peripherals
	real-time non-intrusive visibility and control
	eg: 
		android device emulator
		MAME- arcade emulator
